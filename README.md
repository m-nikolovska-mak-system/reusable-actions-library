# Reusable Actions Library

This repository contains a collection of **reusable GitHub Actions and workflow templates** designed to improve automation, consistency, and efficiency across multiple repositories.  
It includes workflows for Teams notifications, branch naming validation, automated releases, and other CI/CD utilities.  
The goal is to build a centralized internal library that simplifies common DevOps and workflow tasks.


## Available Workflows
| Workflow | Description | Example Path |

| `teams-notify.yml` | Sends notifications to Microsoft Teams on changes | `.github/workflows/teams-notify.yml` |
| `branch-name-validate.yml` | Validates branch naming conventions | `.github/workflows/branch-name-validate.yml` |
| `create-release.yml` | Automates GitHub release creation | `.github/workflows/create-release.yml` |
